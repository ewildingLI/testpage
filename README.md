How to add a video

While editing the markdown file in the online editor on github, you can drag and drop a video file into the page.
Github will show you to the upload progress and will return the url of the video, once it was uploaded successfully:
```https://github.com/ewildingLI/testpage/assets/61542252/4d4e84d6-69a9-4f9c-9370-42fc67b2f77e```

With the url you have to use a little bit of html ...
<video width="254" height="251" src="https://github.com/ewildingLI/testpage/assets/61542252/4d4e84d6-69a9-4f9c-9370-42fc67b2f77e" controls></video>
